## About the Video Course
Learning the fundamentals of image processing puts a powerful and very useful tool at your fingertips. Learning computer vision in LabVIEW is easy to learn, has excellent documentation, and is the base for prototyping all types of vision-based algorithms. Jobs in image processing are plentiful, and being able to learn computer and machine vision will give you a strong background to more easily pick up other computer vision tools such as OpenCV, Matlab, SimpleCV and so on. Suitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 26 lectures and over 4 hours of content, you’ll learn all about computer vision and establish a strong understanding of the concept behind image processing algorithms. Each chapter closes with exercises in which you will develop your own vision-based apps, putting your new learned skills into practical use immediately. Starting with the installation of the LabVIEW Vision Development Toolkit, this course will take you through the main and fundamental image processing tools used in industry and research. At the end of this course you will be able to create the following apps:

App 1 - Counting M&Ms in an image,

App 2 - Colour segmentation and tracking,

App 3 - Coin blob detection

App 4 - Blob range estimation

App 5 - Lane detection and ruler width measurement

App 6 - Pattern or template matching to detect complex objects

App 7 - Object tracking

App 8 - Barcode recognition

App 9 - Optical character recognition (OCR)

With these basic and advanced algorithms mastered, the course will take you through the basic operation of the theory behind each algorithm as well how they applied in real-world scenarios.
